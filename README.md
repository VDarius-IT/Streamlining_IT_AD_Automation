> A comprehensive automation framework for Active Directory user lifecycle management, achieving an **80% reduction in employee onboarding time** by treating infrastructure as code.

This repository provides a real-world blueprint for leveraging **PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC)** to revolutionize Active Directory operations. By defining the state of users, groups, and policies as code, this framework eliminates manual errors, standardizes IT operations, and gives back valuable time to IT professionals.

## üìå The Problem: The High Cost of Manual AD Management

Traditional Active Directory onboarding processes are manual, time-consuming, and notoriously error-prone. They often involve:
*   **Inefficiency:** Onboarding a single employee requires dozens of clicks and manual data entry, taking hours of an IT professional's time.
*   **Inconsistency:** Manual processes lead to inconsistent application of security policies, group memberships, and OU placements, creating security risks.
*   **Human Error:** Typos in usernames, incorrect group assignments, or forgotten permissions are common, leading to Day 1 support tickets and lost productivity.
*   **Scalability Issues:** Manually processing new hires, promotions, and offboarding becomes a significant bottleneck as an organization grows.

## ‚ú® The Solution: Infrastructure as Code for Active Directory

This project reframes Active Directory management by applying the principles of **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using PowerShell DSC. We define *what* we want (the desired state) and let the DSC engine handle the *how* (the implementation).

The core benefits of this approach are:
*   **Declarative Syntax:** You define the end-state of a user or group, not the step-by-step commands to get there.
*   **Idempotency:** The configuration can be run repeatedly. It will only make changes if the current state doesn't match the desired state, making it safe and predictable.
*   **Self-Healing:** DSC can periodically check and correct any configuration drift, ensuring policies and memberships remain compliant.
*   **Auditable & Version-Controlled:** Storing configurations in Git provides a complete, auditable history of every change made to your AD structure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Windows Server with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
*   PowerShell 5.1 or higher
*   Administrator privileges in the target domain
*   Required PowerShell Modules: `PSDscResources`, `xActiveDirectory`

### Step-by-Step Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AD-Automation-DSC.git
    cd AD-Automation-DSC
    ```

2.  **Install Required DSC Modules**
    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name PSDscResources, xActiveDirectory -Force
    ```

3.  **Customize the Configuration Data**
    This is the heart of the automation. Edit `ConfigurationData/Production.psd1` to define your environment, users, and groups.

    **Example `Production.psd1`:**
    ```powershell
    @{
        AllNodes = @(
            @{
                NodeName = 'localhost' # Or your target DC/management server
                PSDscAllowDomainUser = $true
            }
        );

        NonNodeData = @{
            DomainName = "yourdomain.local"
            UserBaseOU = "OU=Employees,DC=yourdomain,DC=local"
            Users = @(
                @{
                    UserName    = "jdoe"
                    FirstName   = "Jane"
                    LastName    = "Doe"
                    Department  = "Marketing"
                    JobTitle    = "Marketing Specialist"
                    # For production, use PSCredential objects or a secrets vault
                    Password    = "P@ssw0rd123!" 
                    Groups      = @("Marketing Users", "All Staff")
                },
                @{
                    UserName    = "bsmith"
                    FirstName   = "Bob"
                    LastName    = "Smith"
                    Department  = "Engineering"
                    JobTitle    = "Software Engineer"
                    Password    = "P@ssw0rd456!"
                    Groups      = @("Engineering Users", "VPN Access", "All Staff")
                }
            )
        }
    }
    ```

4.  **Compile and Apply the Configuration**
    A helper script is provided to generate the `.mof` file and apply the configuration.

    ```powershell
    # This script will compile the config and start the DSC run
    .\Scripts\CompileAndDeploy.ps1
    ```
    Alternatively, you can run the commands manually:
    ```powershell
    # 1. Compile the configuration to create a MOF file
    . .\DSC_Configurations\AD_UserLifecycle.ps1
    AD_UserLifecycle -ConfigurationData .\ConfigurationData\Production.psd1 -OutputPath .\MOF_Output

    # 2. Apply the configuration
    Start-DscConfiguration -Path .\MOF_Output -Wait -Verbose
    ```

5.  **Verify the Results**
    Check Active Directory Users and Computers to confirm the new users and group memberships have been created as defined.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Always test DSC configurations in a non-production lab environment before deploying to production.

## üíº Real-World Workflow Example

**Scenario:** A new developer, "Alice Williams," is joining the Engineering team.

**Action:**
1.  Open `ConfigurationData/Production.psd1`.
2.  Add a new user block for Alice under the `Users` array:
    ```powershell
    @{
        UserName    = "awilliams"
        FirstName   = "Alice"
        LastName    = "Williams"
        Department  = "Engineering"
        JobTitle    = "Senior Developer"
        Password    = "P@ssw0rd789!"
        Groups      = @("Engineering Users", "VPN Access", "Admin Access - Dev", "All Staff")
    }
    ```
3.  Save the file and commit the change to Git.
4.  Run `.\Scripts\CompileAndDeploy.ps1`.

**Result (Fully Automated):**
*   The user account `awilliams` is created in the correct OU.
*   The account is enabled with a temporary password set to change on first login.
*   The user is automatically added to all four specified security groups.
*   All GPOs tied to that OU and those groups are applied on the next login.

What previously took 30+ minutes of manual work is now completed in under a minute with 100% accuracy.
